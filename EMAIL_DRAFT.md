Subject: Submission: TaskFlow - Scalable Web Application (Keerthi Reddy)

Dear Hiring Team,

Please find below the details for my submission for the Web Developer Intern assignment.

**Project Links:**
- **Live Demo:** [https://taskflow-delta.vercel.app/](https://taskflow-delta.vercel.app/)
- **GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/keerthireddy16/taskflow](https://github.com/keerthireddy16/taskflow)

**Key Features Implemented:**
1.  **Full-Stack Architecture:** Next.js 14 (Frontend) + Node.js/Express (Backend) + MongoDB Atlas.
2.  **Authentication:** Secure JWT-based auth with HttpOnly cookies.
3.  **Responsive Dashboard:** Mobile-first design with a collapsible sidebar and smooth transitions.
4.  **Task Management:** CRUD operations for tasks with status tracking.
5.  **Polished UI/UX:**
    -   Custom "TaskFlow" branding.
    -   Dark/Light mode support.
    -   Loading states and error handling.
    -   Interactive landing page with animations.

**Note on Live Demo:**
The backend is hosted on Render's free tier, which may spin down after inactivity.
> **Please allow up to 60 seconds for the initial login/registration to complete as the server wakes up.**
I have added a loading indicator to inform users of this delay.

**Attachments:**
-   My resume is attached to this email.
-   `PROJECT_LOG.md` (in the repo) details my development process and technical decisions.

Thank you for the opportunity! I look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
Keerthi Reddy
