Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to submit my assignment for the Frontend Developer Intern position. I have developed "TaskFlow", a scalable web application with secure authentication and a responsive dashboard, built using Next.js 14 and Node.js/Express.

**Project Links:**
-   **Live Demo:** https://taskflow-delta.vercel.app/
-   **GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/keerthireddy16/taskflow
    *(Please ensure you are logged into GitHub to view if it is private, or let me know if I need to adjust permissions. Currently it is public.)*

**Key Features Implemented:**
-   **Full Authentication**: Secure Register/Login flow using JWTs in HttpOnly cookies (XSS protection).
-   **Responsive Dashboard**: Grid-based layout with task management (CRUD), search, and filtering.
-   **Modern UI/UX**: Blue branding, dark/light mode toggle, and dynamic favicon.
-   **Performance**: Optimized for speed; includes a "Server Waking Up" notification to handle Render's free-tier cold starts gracefully.

**Deliverables Included in Repo:**
-   `README.md`: Detailed setup and deployment guide.
-   `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`: Complete API endpoint reference.
-   `PROJECT_LOG.md`: A summary of my development process, technical decisions, and timeline.

The application is fully deployed (Frontend on Vercel, Backend on Render) and ready for review.

Thank you for this opportunity. I enjoyed building this and look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,

Keerthi Reddy
